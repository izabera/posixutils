Smallutils
==========

For when you're sick of software bloat, and you decide to write your own OS
starting from userspace utilities.

`bin/` contains i686 binaries, run `make` to compile for your architecture.


Comparison (may not be up to date)
----------------------------------

Compare the sizes in bytes vs GNU's version from Arch Linux packages:

|        | Smallutils |  GNU  |
|:------:|:----------:|:-----:|
| `echo` |    5216    | 30436 |
| `cat`  |    3812    | 51044 |
| `rev`  |    3812    | 51044 |


Moar to come...
